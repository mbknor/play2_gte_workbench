This is a temp-project containing working integration code
between Play 2.0 and Groovy Templates (https://github.com/mbknor/gt-engine http://kjetland.com/blog/2011/11/playframework-new-faster-groovy-template-engine/)

For convenience of development I decided to do the integration-code in an actual Play 2 application, and then, later,
move it to a seperate project.

Due to lots of SBT-integration problems, I have decided to stop working on that and instead get as much as possible
working with runtime-on-the-fly-compiling with changed-check as in play 1.

This is working:
 * Basic template stuff
 * all tags (#extends, #include, #list, etc)
 * resolving values ($)
 * resolving messages (&)
 * Checking for errors
 * Using cache
 * Resolving addresses (@)
 * Error messges showing correct source and lineno in templates
 * Finding template files from disk
 * custom tags
 * FastTag-handling-integration
 * loading files from modules
 * resolving template files via resources


This is still not working (Works like a todo list):

 * Resolving absolute addresses (@@)
 * Wrong source is shown when loading not found template from code in controller
  * Might work when integration code is moved out of play-app
 * Code in FastTag that was not moved from play 1 to gt-engine
 * render args,
 * system params (_encoding, all the params that are auto added by play 1)
 * framework supplied template files like select.html


 (This file is going to be updated when progress is made..)

Documentation hints:

When using GTFastTags, you must have a file called gt-fasttags.txt located on the "root" of your classpath (you can put it in the /conf-folder)
Each fasttag must have its full classname on a seperate line in this file

Must have 'uses-groovy-templates.txt'-file on root of classpath in all apps/jars that contain groovy templates.
The template source root folder should be named /gtviews and should also be on the root of the classpath, for example in the conf folder.
