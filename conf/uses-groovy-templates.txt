All apps/jars containing groovy templates must have this file with the name 'uses-groovy-templates.txt'
on the root of its classpath.

Then gte can find all such files on the classpath and then locate
all locations where grovy templates might be found.

The template "root folder" must be in a folder named gtviews on the root of the class path or on the root of the jar.
